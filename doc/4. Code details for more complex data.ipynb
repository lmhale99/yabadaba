    "- Database: The base Database class creates a standard API for database interactions, which the subclasses then implement how to perform the operations with a specific database infrastructure. \n",
    "- Record: The base Record class outlines how to transform the data of a single database entry/record into a variety of formats.  This can be done by manually defining all necessary component methods or more simply by defining Value objects.\n",
    "- Value: A Value class defines how to transform an element in the XML/JSON representation of a record into a basic data type or a Python object.\n",
    "- Query: Each query class contains methods that dictate how to perform an efficient query for a specific type of data in the different Databases. Most of the simple Value objects have a default Query object associated with it."
