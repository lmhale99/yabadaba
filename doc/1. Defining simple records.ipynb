    "The purpose of the Record class is to manage data transformations between multiple different formats.  The easiest way to do this is to define a _init_values() method for the Record class and within it use self._add_value() to define all values in your schema. The _add_value() method creates a new Value object and automatically associates it with the Record class. \n",

    "- __valuerequired__ (*bool, optional*) Indicates if a value must be given for the property.  If True, then checks will be performed that a value is assigned to the property.\n",
    "- __allowedvalues__ (*tuple or None, optional*) A list/tuple of values that the parameter is restricted to have. Setting this to None (default) indicates any value is allowed.\n",
    "- __metadatakey__ (*str, bool or None, optional*) The key name to use for the property when constructing the record metadata dict.  If set to None (default) then name will be used or\n",
    " metadatakey.  If set to False then the parameter will not be included in the metadata dict.\n",
    "- __metadataparent__ (*str or None, optional*) If given, then this indicates that the metadatakey is actually an element of a dict in metadata with this name.  This allows for limited support for metadata having embedded dicts.\n",
    "- __modelpath__ (*str, optional*) The period-delimited path after the record root element for where the parameter will be found in the built data model.  If set to None (default) then name will be used for modelpath.\n",
    "- __description__ (*str or None, optional*) A short description for the value.  If not given, then the record name will be used.\n",
